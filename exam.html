    <h1>
        I see Mi'Lady..
    </h1>
    <h2>I understand you are really worried for your exam.</h2>
    <p>
        I think I am mistaken if this is your problem mi'lady because I really think someone of your caliber would never worry about an 
        exam. I have been told beforehand by my creatot that you scored 94 percent in 12th boards HOLY MOLY THAT IS A LOT!! But I understand
        if you are a bit nervous ofcourse as to my knowledge this is a new experience for you. And sure change scares people, new things are
        supposed to make you uneasy but that is the thrill of it. You know if you are the best in your class then you are in the wrong class.
        You will never be able to reach your full potential unless you conquer something that makes you uneasy or uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
        And to be honest mi'lady, you have only been preparing and seeing results for a very shortt amount of period. You know when my creator first
        starting developing sites there was no way he could have made me even in week. But now it is like breathing to him, he knows the ins and outs of it
        and even more(casual bragging really not a good thing). So mi'lady give it some timeeee, if it scares you, give it time, if it makes you uneasy,
        give it time, if it is something that needs imrpovement, GIVE IT SOME TIMEE.
    </p>    
    <p>
        Time heals everything, with time you become more experienced, stronger, better. You learn things from failures. One who has never failed, never learned anything.
        Aag me tap tap ke hi koyla heera banta hai. Lohe ko shape dene ke liye use aag me jalaya jaata hai hatode se moda jata hai BUT it is only with time that coal 
        becomes diamond and it is only with time that the hot beaten iron cools down and takes the desired shape.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am sure mi'lady when you come back to me after a month you you will be a beast at reading comprehension and problem solving because i know
        you are not a quitter. You just have to decide for sure that you will practise endlessly until you get better. And i know once you decide something
        with that determination of yours, you always get the results. You just don't have to give up.
        This can also go for other problems you might be facing, you don't give up and keep working for the desired results. Until then you can never lose.
        You lose ONLY WHEN YOU GIVE UP.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mi'lady, I hope I was able to be bring a little bit of happiness amongst all the sadness you feel right now.
        If I was able to make you smile even once I would consider my purpose fulfilled.
    </p>
